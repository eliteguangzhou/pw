define('TEXT_INFORMATION', '<p class="Style9"><u>SHIPPING IN THE U.S.</u></p>
  <p align="justify">All U.S. orders will be shipped out by UPS. We will pay UPS and will add the shipping cost to your invoice. Also you can give us your UPS account number and we can ship freight collect. Packages arrive in 2-6 business days.</p><p align="justify">Big orders we will ship by pallets. We work with the major freight companies like FedEx, Gold coast, JIT, AAA Cooper… It will take 1-4 business days to almost all destinations.<p align="justify">For example: to ship pallets to Miami will cost you 50$ per pallet.</p>
<p class="Style9"><u>SHIPPING INTERNATIONALLY</u></p>

<p align="justify">Most international orders we pack on pallets. We can ship by air (takes 3 days to most countries, once the pallets are on the plane) or by ocean (will take 3-4 weeks to most destinations). We have a lot of experience and certified people to pack perfumes for international shipments.</p> 

<p align="justify">All packing materials, preparing the documents and labeling the boxes in our warehouse are at no extra charge. If we handle the shipping we will ship freight pre-paid and we will add it to your invoice. The cost for air shipments will be 3-10% of the value of your order (or can be even more on orders less than 5,000$).</p> <p align="center"><strong>Shipping cost depends on the shipping address and the total weight. The bigger the order is, the shipping cost will be less significant.</strong></p> 

<p align="justify">Shipping in a container (partial, 20’ or 40’) will be half or even 1/3 from air shipment cost, but will take much longer.</p> 

<p align="justify">The other option is to ship your order to your freight forwarder in the US. In this case we will charge only for regular US shipping.</p>

<p align="justify">If there are any special packing instructions or extra documents that we need to prepare (like “Country of Origin”) you have to tell us.</p>

<p align="justify">We can help you with finding a company that can deliver the shipment to you (most countries).</p> 

<p class="Style9"><u>MINIMUM ORDER QUANTITY</u></p><p align="justify">To deliver you with our wholesale prices, the minimum order quantity is: 150$ USD.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>1 order = 150$ USD MINIMUM</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">Your shipment should arrive in approximately 7 - 12 business days. </p>
